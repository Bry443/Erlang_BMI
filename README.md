# Overview

This Erlang application calculates you BMI using a input that you give.

The BMI calculation shows how functions and modules are used to run Erlang.

I wrote this program in order to achieve a better understandings of how Erlang calculates variables and data.

# Development Environment

Ubuntu was run on a virtual system in order to run the erlang routines.

The code was writted within Visual Studio Code. The code was entirely Erlang.

Erlang was the programming language used for this application.
